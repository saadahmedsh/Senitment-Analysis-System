No arguments from me son - the Maggie scene is glorious.

Very few films turned a profit based on theatrical grosses alone this year. Even No Time To Die, the top grossing Hollywood film worldwide is reportedly set to lose $100m.  2021 theatrical box office is a building year about coaxing moviegoers back.  ""Hit"" and ""bomb"" don't apply.

I mean, she apparently had a big role in Spectre, which we all watched, but we had never seen her before.
