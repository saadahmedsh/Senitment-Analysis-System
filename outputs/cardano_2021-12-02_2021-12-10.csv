This is not true, there is a first DEX: https://ada.muesliswap.com/swap

more DEXes are coming within weeks... for sure until end of the year.
ada.muesliswap.com

It's all about perspective. The entire industry is NOT ready for the masses, we are too young to handle that load. The chains that focus on being impenetrable rather than fast will win in the long run. It's about building with long time-horizon foresight. Cardano is killing it.

You can turn metaverse land as collateral to get a loan, also lend/borrow NFTs and other metaverse assets. Could be worth a look. $PBX is launching staking feature this month and their MVP in Q1 2022. It is still under the radar, like all other Cardano projects.
