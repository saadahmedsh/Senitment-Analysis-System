I'm not entirely sure it wud. This shows how opensource & decentralized the XRPL is. Ripple cud address things, but alone can't make any changes on the XRPL w/out putting thru an amendment which 80% of validators would have 2 vote on. And boom, more proof of decentralization.

This is great point. The outcome of the case against $XRP won’t give clarity on yield farming, crypto lending, stable coin backing, & more.

They are definitely fighting for all crypto, but personally IDC how the Ripple/BG/CL suits end, as long as todays $XRP can trade freely.

Right, and Ripple is incentivized just like we are for the ledger to be functional and efficient. But, since they’re just one stakeholder of many working on this effort, I think that’s a major talking point they can use to their advantage in this case.

Apologies, but don't think Flywire is a Ripple user, at least not confirmed. The consensus about the article seemed to be the Ripple mention is an aside, not a description of Flywire/Citi Ripple use. They talk about their future crypto use here, though:
finance.yahoo.com
Flywire CEO: ‘I see us definitely looking at crypto on the roadmap’
Mike Massaro, Flywire CEO, joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the company going public on the Nasdaq and growth opportunities for the future.

Interesting question.  Yes, if the SEC loses, Congress could pass laws ""changing"" XRP to a security I imagine. But Congress can't pass ex-post facto laws (which make something illegal ""after the fact"" so any law Congress passed would only apply to XRP from the date of passage.

“Venetian masks provide wearers with exaggerated features—a long, pointy nose or a rounded brow, for instance—meant to portray particular character traits or emotions while protecting the wearer's identity.”

So he’s hiding behind this mask character to protect his identity.

The SEC used Hinman's Yahoo public speech as clarity for ETH. However, they continually deny that. This is the reason why the Ripple case is so important. Because it makes the SEC either eat their words. Or admit that they really did follow Hinman's opinion/speech regarding ETH.

You might not be aware of

ETH isn't even done. In fact, ETH relies on other projects like polygon and arbitrum to maintain its use case. XRP is a finished product doing what ETH is still trying to achieve. So what in tarnation are you talking about???

John, I’m genuinely confused. Considering ‘Ripple’ didn’t create Xrp, how could it be deemed a security? Xrp existed before Ripple did, does that not negate this securities argument? Oranges before the orange grove existed…
