hello.  today make a deposit of € 850 euros for immediate transfer and it has not arrived.  When entering my account it tells me that my remaining limit is € 500, the other day it indicated € 4000 per day and now it indicates € 1000 per day.  Is there any way to fix this?",,,,,[],https://twitter.com/charlyaudio/status/1469078401768210437
