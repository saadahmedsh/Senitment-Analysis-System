The biggest challenge of the financial system is that it's built on a system of debt and the fractional reserve model is nothing but a cash cow for banks.  That is the issue with stability.  Bitcoin solves that with a model built on $/trust/verification and not debt.

Reading the Bitcoin Standard only costs $20 and it’s basically all anyone would need to know. $850 is way too much

When I got in Bitcoin was at $2500 each and everyone had similar tales. I didn't believe it would ever cross $10,000 and look at it now.
Be patient ...and when it crashes just turn your phone off and don't look for six months.

I don’t care that she’s charging money for her course.  What’s cringeworthy to me is porting over normie culture and values - “we need more (demographic) in Bitcoin.”

It reduces people to a portion of their identity and seeks to paint them as a victim.

You are the second bull in the last hour to pursue this line of reasoning.

Indeed that was a great point to get into that relative trade, as I pointed out.

My view is not “bearish” Bitcoin,  my view is that all Bitcoin price statements are false, and the price is unknowable.

I also take issue with Bitcoin inclusion efforts being financially inaccessable to most women. However, a lot of these comments seem more about attacking gender inclusion than promoting financial inclusion.
