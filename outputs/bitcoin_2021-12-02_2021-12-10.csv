Kadena is still in a pressure point zone. 

When breaking upwards we will see bullish momentum. When going downwards it can go hard. Nothing really changed.

You buy the option to purchase Bitcoin at 100k in December (in this example)
If it is above 100k you make money because you can buy at 100k and sell for the higher price.

Currently, in Eth2 4 entities add up to 33%, which is as bad as the PoW counterparts - Eth1 it takes 3 to get to 51% and BTC takes 6. This has been disappointing for improving the Nakamoto Coefficient, a measure of censorship resistance.

Consider the possibility that Bitcoin is in a range, consolidating before another move on its path towards “digital gold”.   

In that scenario, multiple assaults at the (to that moment) ATH will result in substantial liquidation driven corrections, each smaller than the last.

But economies of scale still apply, so the power and money inevitably end up in the hands of a small elite. Bitcoin is effectively controlled by only a handful of people, everybody else is just along for the ride.
